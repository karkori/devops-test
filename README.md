# devops-test
This is a small node.js webapp using Express, and it is dockerized with Docker. The objective with this mini-project is to implement the different tools and techniques of the DevOps methodology. To Lunch the node processes I've implemented the forever daemon tool.

## Running the app
```
npm start
```
The server is listening on localhost port 3000:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
We can access two resources: ***/*** and **/users**
